#### Profile
I have never been a programmer, though I was anxious to be a manong many years ago. In fact, I know only a little about programming.

#### About this website
This is a static website based on html,js and css scripts, produced by a local running program, staticPageMaker, a typical content administration system based on python.I made it in 2016 and updated it in the early Feb. of 2020 when covid-19 was raging in our country. More info about this program is available [here](https://github.com/hioldbig/staticPageMaker). 

#### Why pretend to (zhuangbi in Chinese cyber language) use English?
Somebody questioned me why I use English since my mother tongue is Chinese. For 365 days a year, apart from sleeping, I am always speaking in Chinese. Chinese is my mother language for ever. Though I haven't mastered English very well, I think English is very interesting and I believe that multilingualism helps better communication, and what's more, I have to use English in many occasions.
